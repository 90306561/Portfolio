My Portfolio

Hi, my name is Erik Peterson, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 4th grade on Khan Academy, learning a small bit of JavaScript. In 9th grade, I decided to take AP Computer Science Principles, in which I learned basic code and made apps with MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. This year, I have been taking an iOS App development class in which I learned Swift. So far this year, I have made 1 working app with my team, and a further developing a second app I had started at the beginning of the year. 

*[uiTest](https://github.com/90306561/UItest.git)
This was my very first XCode project. In this project I learned the basics of coding in Swift, along with some of the syntax. This was the first part of the Code With Chris tutorials. Along with this, I also had a handful of swift playgrounds learning about functions, variables, etc. 

*[StickerTest](https://github.com/90306561/StickerTest.git)
Made a stickers app. Learned how to resize an image to a billion different size formats.

*[War](https://github.com/90306561/war.git)
War game where the button changes the cards This is the second iteration of the war game. This version has a button which changes the cards, as well as text that updates the score after each click. This is where I learned how to code a button.

*[Landmarks](https://github.com/90306561/Landmarks.git)
Apple's Landmarks Tutorials Learned a bunch of formatting stuff. How to add different image frames and other Appley stuff.

*[Hungry Alien](https://github.com/90306561/HungryAlien.git)
My first app I made a basic app where you click a button and the alien "eats" a random food that changes its hapiness and healthiness.
