My Portfolio

Hi, my name is Erik Peterson, and this is a portfolio of apps and projects I've made throughout the years. My first exposure to code was in 4th grade on Khan Academy, learning a small bit of JavaScript. In 9th grade, I decided to take AP Computer Science Principles, in which I learned basic code and made apps with MIT App Inventor. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned Java. This year, I have been taking an iOS App development class in which I learned Swift. So far this year, I have made 1 working app with my team, and a further developing a second app I had started at the beginning of the year.

* [uiTest](https://github.com/90306561/UItest.git)
  This was my very first XCode project. In this project I learned the basics of coding in Swift, along with some of the syntax. This was the first part of  the Code With Chris tutorials. Along with this, I also had a handful of swift playgrounds learning about functions, variables, etc.

* [StickerTest](https://github.com/90306561/StickerTest.git)
  This was my sticker app. In this project I learned how to resize one image to a bunch of different sizes so that I could add it as the AppIcon. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [War](https://github.com/90306561/war.git)
  This was part of the Code With Chris tutorials. In this app, I learned how to add buttons. The buttons were used to change the cards as well as the text,   updating it with the score after each click. 
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Landmarks](https://github.com/90306561/Landmarks.git)
  This was part of Apple's XCode tutorial. In this tutorial, I learned how to add and manipulate JSON files, as well as add masks to images within the       code. 
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Angry Duck](https://github.com/90306561/AngryDuck.git)
  This was part of a youtube tutorial I found online. The game itself is a basic version of angry birds. I followed this tutorial to learn how to use
  physics to affect sprites, as well as how to drag sprites across the screen, following your finger. I used these concepts in my next project, Hungry 
  Alien.

* [Hungry Alien](https://github.com/90306561/HungryAlien.git)
  This was my very first independent app that I made. It is a basic app where you various food items float around and you have to swipe them to the UFO to 
  "eat" them. Eating various foods changes the "hapiness" and "healthiness" of the alien. 
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Bubble Words](https://github.com/90306561/BubbleWords.git)
  I developed this app with my team using all the previous knowledge I had learned throughout my past projects. In this app you have a 5x6 grid of 
  randomized letters, a shooter that shoots a circle at the letters forming a word. It then checks the word, and if it is a valid word, it adds points 
  (scrabble letter values) to your score.
